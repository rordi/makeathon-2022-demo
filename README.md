# Semafours Demo

## Build Setup

You need to have a recent version of Node.js installed on your machine (tested on v14 LTS). If you have Node Version
Manager, you can simply:

```bash
$ nvm use
```

Then install dependencies and start the development webserver:

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev
```

If all goes well, you will find the web app running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
